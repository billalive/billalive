# Writer. Coder. Data Scientist.

## A Rare Intersection of Skills

Writing? Coding? Data Science? I offer you the complete package. Do you need:

- A **data scientist** who can also tell a **compelling story?**
- A **technical writer** who can also **code?**
- A **coder** who can also **communicate?**

I’d love to help.

I’ve been publishing my [writing](https://portfolio.billalive.com/nonfiction/) since high school in the late 90s, tinkering with [Linux](https://portfolio.billalive.com/code/#linux-enthusiast) since 2004, and making websites professionally since 2005.

Along the way, I’ve researched and written articles and books on extreme [memory improvement](https://portfolio.billalive.com/nonfiction/memory/), published short stories, plays, and [seven novels](https://portfolio.billalive.com/novels/), written and acted in short films and podcasts, released open source [tools I’ve coded](https://portfolio.billalive.com/code/), and finally, discovered the field where I can use all my favorite skills at once: [data science](https://portfolio.billalive.com/data-science/).

## My Ideal Client

I hold a [Micromasters Certificate in Data Science](https://data.billalive.com/certification) from the University of California San Diego. 

Data science lets me bring *all* my major skills to the table: elegant **coding**, intense intellectual **analysis**, and finding the compelling **stories** in this data that can make complex topics **understandable** to non-experts.

I've published [several reports](https://data.billalive.com) as Jupyter Notebooks, each of which explores a complex question using an official dataset.

I basically live in Emacs, the shell, and Firefox running [Vimium](https://vimium.github.io/). Many years ago, Perl was my first love... but Python won me over. 

I do enjoy R's `tidyverse` (especially the [pipe](https://magrittr.tidyverse.org/reference/pipe.html)), but the Python module ecosystem feels orders of magnitude more diverse than what R has to offer. Though R offers excellent tools for data analysis, with Python, you get that plus *everything else*.
